    <h2>The Lord of the Rings - J. R. R. Tolkien</h2>
The Lord of the Rings is an epic high-fantasy novel written by English author<br/>
 J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit,<br/>
 but  eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, much <br/>
of it during World War II, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels<br/>
 ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.<br/><br/>

The title of the novel refers to the story's main antagonist, the Dark Lord Sauron,<br/>
 who had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power<br/>
 as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth.<br/>
 From quiet beginnings in the Shire, a hobbit land not unlike the English countryside,<br/>
 the story ranges across northwest Middle-earth, following the course of the War<br/>
 of the Ring through the eyes of its characters, the hobbits Frodo Baggins,<br/>
 Samwise "Sam" Gamgee, Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck and Peregrin "Pippin" Took,<br/>
 but also the hobbits' chief allies and travelling companions: the Men Aragorn,<br/>
 a Ranger of the North, and Boromir, a Captain of Gondor; Gimli, a Dwarf warrior;<br/>
 Legolas, an Elven prince; and Gandalf, a Wizard.<br/><br/>

The work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two-volume set,<br/>
 the other to be The Silmarillion, but this idea was dismissed by his publisher.<br/>
 For economic reasons The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over<br/>
 the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955. The three volumes<br/>
 were titled The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King.<br/>
 Structurally, the novel is divided internally into six books, two per volume,<br/>
 with several appendices of background material included at the end of the third volume.<br/>
 Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume. The Lord of the Rings<br/>
 has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into many languages.<br/>
<br/><br/>
Tolkien's work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins.<br/>
 Although a major work in itself, the story was only the last movement of a larger<br/>
 epic Tolkien had worked on since 1917, in a process he described as mythopoeia.<br/>
 Influences on this earlier work, and on the story of The Lord of the Rings,<br/>
 include philology, mythology, religion and the author's distaste for the effects<br/>
 of industrialization, as well as earlier fantasy works and Tolkien's experiences<br/>
 in World War I. The Lord of the Rings in its turn is considered to have had<br/>
 a great effect on modern fantasy; the impact of Tolkien's works is such that the<br/>
 use of the words "Tolkienian" and "Tolkienesque" has been recorded in the Oxford<br/>
 English Dictionary.<br/><br/>

The enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references<br/>
 in popular culture, the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkien's works,<br/>
 and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. The Lord of the<br/>
 Rings has inspired, and continues to inspire, artwork, music, films and television,<br/>
 video games, and subsequent literature. Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings<br/>
 have been made for radio, theatre, and film.<br/><br />
